# 🛰️ Geopolitical Threat Intelligence Lab

Welcome to the Geopolitical Threat Intelligence Lab — a hands-on repository dedicated to tracking advanced persistent threats (APTs) and state-aligned cyber actors, mapping geopolitical events to cyber operations, and developing OSINT workflows to monitor shifting threat landscapes.

This lab is designed to explore the intersection of cybersecurity, geopolitics, and intelligence analysis. It combines open-source research, adversary profiling, enrichment techniques, and contextualized threat reporting in a structured, repeatable format.

  Monitor the motivations, capabilities, and tactics of nation-state and proxy groups targeting critical sectors and global regions.

- **Map Geopolitical Events to Cyber Operations**  
  Analyze how elections, conflicts, diplomatic shifts, and sanctions correlate with targeted cyber activity.

- **Build and Share OSINT Workflows**  
  Demonstrate scalable, transparent, and ethical OSINT techniques for identifying, enriching, and contextualizing threat intelligence.
